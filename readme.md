how to run thisï¼š

I recommend running the downloader.py directly in the PyCharm development environment. 

When you copy the movie URL from MissAV, it is best to use the English version of the MissAV page

You need Python 3

type 1 : custom urls, change movie_urls into yourself

type 2 : login your account automatically and download movies from your movie collections

type 3 : download from a public playlist url

Due to the m3u8 fragment download, the more CPU logical threads there are, the faster the download speed

ps: 

1. If you are from an ancient eastern country, then you may need to use a network proxy
2. If an error occurs during the run, try commenting out the first line of code, using the second line of code, and running again.
